# Oculus™ Quest 2

## Recommended gear

* The Oculus Quest 2 itself. I bought the 64 GB model, but I'd recommend 256 GB - big games will fill it up.
* Improved head strap. The one that comes with it is not very comfortable. I've got the official Elite Strap, and it's definitely an improvement. Even then, with two people you'll probably do some adjusting.
* [VR Cover](https://us.vrcover.com/collections/oculus%E2%84%A2-quest-2) sells excellent add-ons for the Quest. I bought their Facial Interface & Foam Replacement set, which I really like. Consider signing up for their newsletter. _(Avoid cheap alternatives.)_
* Improved controller grips with hand straps. I have some from CNBEYOUNG through Amazon; they're nice but a little bulky. I'd like to try the VR Cover ones. VR Cover also makes controller protectors, which seem like a good idea for games like GORN.
* Headphones or earbuds. These make a **big** difference. I have the Logitech G333 VR Gaming Earphones, which were designed for the Quest. They sound good and the cords are the right lengths, but sometimes they fall out of my ears.
* A case, especially if you want to transport it. I bought a CASEMATIX Hard Case through Amazon; you can customize the foam however you like. It's not super-high quality, but it works and it's lightweight. It protects the lenses from sunlight (**bad**) and scratches.
* A dry optical lens microfiber cloth to clean the lenses.
* An anti-fatigue mat. I use a Gorilla Grip kitchen mat from Amazon. Place this in the center of your gaming area. It keeps your feet from getting tired and lets you orient by feel.

## Recommended games and apps

* In Death: Unchained. This has the most replay value of any game I've played on the Quest. It's a roguelike bow shooter with incredible depth.
* Arizona Sunshine. This zombie FPS is extremely well done. I've played through the main quest and two DLCs. The Damned DLC had a [glitch](https://twitter.com/BillSorensen/status/1334337763726950400) that forced me to restart it from the beginning, but it was still worth it. It also supports multiplayer.
* GORN. If you don't mind cartoonish violence, this gladiator fighting game will let you vent your frustrations while getting a workout. Make sure you have enough room; I've come close to breaking a controller when throwing a punch. Setting the Guardian so that breaking the boundary pauses the game helps.
* The Wizards. If you've ever wanted to cast spells with gestures, this fantasy game is for you. It doesn't have a lot of replay value for me, though.
* Myst. Puzzle games aren't my jam, but my wife really liked this.
* Beat Saber. The quintessential music/rhythm game.
* SKYBOX VR Video Player. If you have a NAS (network-attached storage) device on your home network and store videos on there, this will let you wirelessly stream them to your Quest. It works with multiple formats, including VR videos. It doesn't work with photos, though - if you want to view those, check out Pigasus VR Media Player. I like SKYBOX better for videos, though.

## Other tips

* Use a Facebook account under your real name. I've heard about people losing access to their accounts (and their games) by violating the terms of service (using a handle, fake name, etc.).
* Adjust the [IPD](https://support.oculus.com/351344152731317/) to match your eyes.
* Check out [App Lab](https://developer.oculus.com/blog/introducing-app-lab-a-new-way-to-distribute-oculus-quest-apps/) for beta games. See the [directory](https://applab.games/).
* Update your Quest and games regularly.
