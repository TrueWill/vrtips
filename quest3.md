# Meta Quest 3

I purchased this recently, so more to come.

## Recommended gear

* Improved head strap. I bought the Elite Strap but there are other (probably cheaper) options.
* If you already have earphones for the Quest 2, you can reuse those. The audio jack moved to the other side though, so you may find that left and right channels are effectively reversed and that your cables aren't long enough to switch ears. That was my experience with the Logitech G333 ones. If this happens to you, you can buy an inexpensive short 3.5mm male-to-female stereo audio headset extension cable ([this one](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01DCBJ51I) worked for me) and move the earphones around.
* Download a phone app to measure your IPD (Inter Pupillary Distance) in order to accurately set that on your Quest. I used GlassesOn but there are several. I repeated the measuring to make sure the results matched.

## Recommended games and apps

* Dungeons of Eternity. This is a _very_ immersive dungeon crawl. The physics are fun; I love the bows and throwing axes. It has multiplayer support but I haven't tried that yet.
* In Death: Unchained. I've recommended this before, but with the latest update it's even better on the Quest 3.
* Meta Quest Browser. Apparently YouTube VR does not support higher resolutions; the browser allows you to choose. I used to use Firefox Reality but Mozilla no longer supports that.
* Pistol Whip. This is an older game, but I finally picked it up. Sort of John Wick set to music, but the violence is not particularly graphic. You will get exercise playing this game, dodging bullets and obstacles.

## Other games

I've been playing Asgard's Wrath 2 and find it immersive but frustrating. The controls aren't as well-designed as those in Dungeons of Eternity. It's not obvious how to solve some of the puzzles.

I've played Arizona Sunshine 2 a little; so far I'm enjoying it.
